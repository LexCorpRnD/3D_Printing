Tsuba Test: Blank Tsuba, Blank Design Tsuba and Mark 1 Tsubas

Objective: Ensure Tsubas are safe for use in full contact Kendo pratices.

Testing: Attached Tsuba to Shinai and performed multiple strikes with and against the Tsuba to test side, top, bottom and angled impacts. In addition, I performed several attacks against my wooden deck for stranious testing.

Results:
Test 1: Blank Tsuba and Blank Design Tsuba with medium material fill were obliterated after 20 strikes against my deck. Dangerous shattering observed.

Test 2: Blank Tsuba and Blank Design Tsuba with max material fill and thicken surfaces performed well. I was unable to shatter the tsuba after 40-50 strikes against my deck. Blank Design Tsuba experienced minimal cracking along the inner tsuba ring where its thinest.

NOTE: DO NOT USE TSUBAS WITH LESS THEN MAXIMUM FILL AND SURFACE LAYERS LESS THEN 3-4 LAYERS THICK.

Test 3: Mark 1 Tsubas are based off of the Blank Design Tsuba. The inner ring of the tsuba wear out quickly and minimal cracking was observed. Initial thought was to find a clear fill material for the mesh cutout in the tsuba.

Test 4: Mark 1 Tsubas with clear hobby store resin inlays. Tsubas look amazing, but the resin cracks after a few strikes.

NOTE: NEED TO FIND SUITABLE RESIN OR POLYMER FOR TSUBA INLAYS OR REVERT BACK TO BLANK TSUBA USE ONLY.
